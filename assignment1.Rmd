## My Goals for HUDK4050

* Goal 1: Learn to acquire, compile, analyze and report academic research data
* Goal 2: Develop a portfolio of educational data science projects
* Goal 3: Work hard and get a good grade

## Video Review

I think what can be changed is to give more examples, especially code workout.
What can be kept is the subtitles of the video, because sometimes it is hard to hear clearly.

| Skill | Score |

|Coding |    1.5|
| Good  |  Fit  |
