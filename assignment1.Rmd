## My Goals for HUDK4050

* Get familiarize with R, RStudio, Git, and Github
* Learn coding
* Participate in all 5 Hackathon

## Video Review

I think all the class videos were very informative especially the git exercise video, which clearly shows each step for working an repository.
I would like to keep videos short but also instructive instead of having super long videos that are tedious.
I would also like to see more instruction videos such as the git exercise because it will help students who have no past experience in coding.

## This is how I am feeling about the semester
