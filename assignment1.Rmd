# Assignment 1 
https://github.com/qiqi1313114


## My Goal For HUDK4050
* Learn how to use R 
* Learn how to collect and analyze data with R
* Get to collaborate with my classmates 

## Video Review 
I would say these videos are really succinct and easy to understand,  
so I would say most of things should be kept.  
However, I do think the script can be organized better so that we don't  
have to drag all the way to the right to see it. 

Skill    | Score 
---------| ---------
R        | 1
Succint  | Easy to understand


## This is how I am feeling about the semester
