# Assignment 1

[Kari Li's Githun profile page](https://github.com/Kaririri)


## My Goals for HUDK 4050

- Learn basic learning analytics theories and application
- Finish the seven course projects on time
- Attend six office hours


## Video Review

I have seen the SQL 1.1 | Introduction to Relational Databases & SQL. It is a great introduction to SQL with some background knowledge and its importance and applications in job seeking process. One thing that I wish could be better would be the audio because I was having a hard time to hear the voice clearly.


| Skill | Score |
|---|---|
| coding | 3 |
| Good introducation | Wish some termologies could be explained in the video or in a separate document to provide additional background information to a complete beginner |


## This is how I am feeling about the semester
