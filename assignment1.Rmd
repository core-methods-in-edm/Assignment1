## My Goals for HUDK4050

* To develop understanding of how new data sources can be used in education 
* To hone my skill sets in analyzing and evaluating data sets via new technologies  
* To utilize my funds of knowledge and apply to broader practices in life  

## Video Review

I love the entry scene with music--very aesthetically pleasing and engages me better to the later content. I would also keep the length as well as the structure of the video because they are concise and effective. For things to change, I would love to see more graphs and pictures in the video. 

| Skill     | Score |
| Photoshop |  3    |
| Effective | Great |

## This is how I am feeling about the semester
