## My Goals for hudk4050 {.css_class}
 - As a novice in programming, I hope to develop my coding skills and become more familiar and competent in data mining. 
 - By taking more practices and build my own projects, I hope to better understand how various softwares work on a deeper level.
 - I would also like to learn from others and develop programming skills in a community like this class. 
 
## Video Review {.css_class}
I really enjoyed watching these class videos. Having both the voice instruction with the visual display helped me a lot to make sense of the steps I need to go through. I appreciate the how detailed and also concise these videos are. For example, in lecture 2.4 git exercise, I like how in the end there is a list of main steps as a summary for the process. It makes it easier to understand and follow.
