## Video Review
*I enjoy watching the class videos, as they are clear and easy to follow. I Would love the opportunity to engage with my classmates on class videos through discussions, comments, etc.*

Skill | Score
------|------
Coding | The *R/RStudio & Git/Github* video provides great guidance and additional resources.
3 | The *Git & Github Walk Through* video is easy to follow.
