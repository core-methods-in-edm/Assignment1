# Assignment 1

## My Goals for HUDK4050
* Learn how to use the R language
* Develop a better sense of how data can be used in various settings
* Potentially create some mini-projects with the stuff I will learn in this class

## Video Review
* The videos have been great. The only suggestion that I would have is that, since the videos are quite short, it would be great to include some additional related information of the discussed topic so that we can have some extra materials to work with.

Skill  |  Score
-----  |  -----
Coding |    2
The class video so far has been very helpful and easy to follow | I like the way professor explains the process of what we need to do

## This is how I am feeling about the semester
