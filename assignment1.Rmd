## My Goals for HUDK4050  

Below are a few of my goals for this class.  

* I'd like to become comfortable using R  
* I'd like to learn to do regression analysis
* I'd like to learn to make a basic Shiny App

## Video Review 

I'm impressed with the videos for this course. I continue to believe they are created and produced with a degree of polish I am not likely to experience in other courses here at TC. Nonetheless I'm asked to share review points. As it turns out, I am very well practiced at providing production edit points for videos (in my day gig, our organization has produced hundreds of explanatory, training, and testimonial videos, and i am very particular in my reviews of those videos). So here's some thoughts.

#### things i like 

* you have outstanding eye contact ⭐⭐⭐
* your telepromtping is very well done  ⭐⭐⭐
* your screencaptures and chyron are done very well and smoothly integrated ⭐⭐⭐


#### things i would change 

* all video links from your bookdown.org course page should open in a new tabs, this allows the course page to always remain on its original tab 
* ~14 second intro is too long... try for ~5 sec 
* end as many videos as possible with some type of 'what did you learn' screen 
* your productions deserve and outro... try for ~5 seconds
* your debonair voice sometimes gets raspy, hydrate before and during breaks.
