# Assignment 1

[My Github Profile](https://github.com/dl3418)

## My Goals for HUDK4050

* Get familiar with coding
* Be able to apply coding skills into practical educational analysis
* Learn to understand facts through data

## Video Review

For class videos, I would keep those screen recording which explain the steps of coding and using Rstudio. I would add more text descriptions for key points.

| Skill  | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Skiing |     3 |
| Coding |   1.5 |

## This is how I am feeling about the semester.
