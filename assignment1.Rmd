## Video Review
I really enjoy watching class videos and learning R, which I have expected for a long time. All the synchronous and asynchronous activities of this class are well-designed. I would like to keep pace with our schedule.

|Skill|Score|

|R Programming|0|
|The lessons so far are really helpful and easy to follow.|It will be better if the video transcript can be put in the main body of the page instead of the code block.|
