[my github profile](https://github.com/louiserr98)

## My Goals for HUDK4050 

   + Be able to use Rstudio smoothly 
   + Understand the power of date 
   + use data to tackle a problem(maybe?)

## Video Review
I would get to know more about the terms and use of Rstudio keep being curious about R.

Skill | Score
- | :-: 
Dance | 90
Rmarkdown | 10
It's really basic and useful | hope it could be more detailed
