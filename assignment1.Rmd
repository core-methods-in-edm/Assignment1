# Assignment 1

[My Github Profile](https://github.com/Yifei0710)

## My Goals for HUDK4050

* Gain proficiency in developing an educational data solution from start to finish.
* Gain proficiency in R.
* Build up my Github.

## Video Review

* I really like the design, pictures and music of the beginning of the video. It captures my attention immediately.
* What I would change: The volume of the video could be louder.
* What I would keep:  I like keeping the video short and each video just elabrates on one topic. The organization of the content is very clear and informative. 

| Skill | Score |
|-----:|:-----|
|R|3/10|
|I like it very much!| The pace is very good!|

## This is how I am feeling about the semester
