### My Goals for HUDK4050
* Learn basic data mining/data analysis skills.
* Learn to analyze educational data.
* Gain insights about how data mining has been used and could be used in education.

### Video Review
I really like the videos, and I think these videos are very informative. One thing I want to keep is the highlight points and images on the screen, which helps me to understand the lecture better.

Skill  | Score
------------- | -------------
data analysis with R  | I like all the videos. I think the lectures are useful
1/10  | I like the intro music at the beginning

### This is how I am feeling about the semester
