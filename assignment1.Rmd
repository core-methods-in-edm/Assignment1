# Assignment 1

[Jiasheng (Andy) Yu Profile](https://github.com/JiashengYu618)



## My Goals for HUDK4050

- Improve my programming skills in R
- Make friends with other students
- Cooperate with Charles and other students and improve my communication skills



## Video Review

After watching the videos I think I learned a really quick way to commit my code by using RStudio. Actually, I am familiar with using command to commit my code but sometimes, I might make some mistakes. So, it's really convenient by using RStudio to commit my code. Also, I know how to use markdown before but never use it in RStudio. I think it is also a convenient way for us to comment code.

What I  want to keep is my patience in the work and the thing I want to change is sometimes I am too quiet , I should be become more active in the class.


| Skill |  Score |
| :-:| :-:|
| Communication | I think if some students ask some questions, you can answer them through videos |
|7| I think all the videos are detailed |



## This is how I am feeling about the semester
