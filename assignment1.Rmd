## Video Review
Videos' contents are nice and concise. All instructions are pretty clear and organized. I hope we can keep this concise form.

| Skill | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Coding | 4 |
| I love all videos | some are blurred |


```{r}
library(knitr)
dataInfo <- matrix(c('Coding',7,'All Videos are concise and great. I hope we can have more live coding videos.','Maybe we can improve some videos\' quality. They are only 360P. '),ncol=2,byrow=TRUE)
colnames(dataInfo) = c('Skill', 'Score')
rownames(dataInfo) = c('','')
dataInfo = as.table(dataInfo)
final_table = kable(dataInfo)
final_table
```

## This is how I am feeling about the semester
