# Assignment 1
[My Github](https://github.com/amanda-ago)

## My Goals for HUDK4050
* Learn how to code in R
* Learn how to use R for data analysis. Current experience: Stata
* Get introduced to big data in Education. Current experience: Statewide and Nationwwide longitudinal data systems in Education. 


## Video Review 
* The way the content is distributed, in short videos, is very effective and easy to follow.
* It would be helpful to have the content made available according to a certain schedule. For instance, knowing that new content posts at 5pm T/R would make my weekly planning a lot easier. This way I would be able to set aside a certain time to study and work on the projects. 
* Would be helpful to have video transcripts available in the Youtube video description. 


| Skill | Score |
|-----| ----|
| Data Analysis in R | 4/10 | 
| It does not make sense to add my "opinion of the class videos" to this Skill/Score table | But since you asked, I like the videos and am looking forward to the next ones | 


## This is how I am feeling about the semester
