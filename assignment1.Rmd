<https://github.com/Lynn-Jiaxin>


## My Goals for HUDK4050
* get familar with coding by using R and R studio
* gain experience in git and github
* be able to complete some complex data analysis independently

## Video Review
I like the videos to be divided into pieces by different contents which are easier for looking up some specific content in the future. And I like the summary of the video content at the end of the video.

| Skill | Score |
| :------: | :------: |
| Reading | 5 |
| Brief and Clear | Convenient |

## This is how I am feeling about the semester
