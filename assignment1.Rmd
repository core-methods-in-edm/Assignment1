# Assignment 1
<https://github.com/anneeexiao>

## My Goals for HUDK 4050
- Goal 1 Know how to use R
- Goal 2 Know how to use R to do statistics and make interpretations
- Goal 3 Improve skill of logical thinking

## Video Review
I have watched all the videos so far. I got a brief insight of what the R/R studio is, and what the git/github is. Basically R is a coding language mainly used for statistical analysis, and it was developed based on S. R studio is an interaction community where people can organize their work into project. We use Rmarkdown to write and run our codes. Git tracks changes to files and github is a online community where we can save our changes made on codes.  

The thing that I would change: go through all the videos at the end of week. 
The thing I would keep: always be passion  

|Skill   | Scores|
