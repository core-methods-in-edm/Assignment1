## My Goals for HUDK4050  

* Goal 1
* Goal 2
* Goal 3  

## Video Review

I liked the way that the videos were presented and don't want change.

| Skill                            | Score                             |

| Rock climbing                    | 4                                 |
| I just went to a music festival. | I have a lot of work to do after. |

## This is how I am feeling about the semester

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
