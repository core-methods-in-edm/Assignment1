# Assignment 1
Here is my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/YingxinXie).

## My goals for HUDK 4050
* make usful application of fatched data
* have a basic idea of data mining and other analytical procedures
* gain proficiency in using R

## Video Review
* R is an innovative language with collective effort and developed with negotiated consensus
* RStudio provides an interactive development environment of R
* Git is a version control system that can track every change make to a file
* GitHub allows the Git system to work across the internet.
* I think this course has provided a very detailed introduction to the overall R and GitHub. I have had several statistical courses that using R as the tool but these background information haven't been underlined in such clear manner. Besides that, I would like to add some simple tasks to better explore functions and different options in R. So that we could get into its working style faster. I also believe there are more interesting assignments in the coming weeks. Looking forward to working for them!
