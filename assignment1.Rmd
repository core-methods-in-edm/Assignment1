[My Github Profile](https://github.com/StevenLu1213)

## My Goals for HUDK4050

* Goal 1 Know basic functions and operation of R 
* Goal 2 Start basic level of data-related coding 
* Goal 3  Learn further without external assistance

## Video Review

It might be better if Charles could wear a pair of earphone or prepare a mic, as sometimes the voice is a bit deep, and it might be unclear to be heard.
It is good to see those special terms or codes demonstrated in the video synchronously when they are being discussed.
