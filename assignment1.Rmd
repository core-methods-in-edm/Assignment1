# Assignment 1

[My Github Profile](https://github.com/rs4099)

## My Goals for HUDK4050

* Goal 1 Gain data mining skills to help me look for, define and solve real world problems
* Goal 2 Apply these skills to do excellently in product analytics and data visualization & presentation
* Goal 3 Get data science mindset

## Video Review

Best online course video ever! Fun and cute! 
* What I would keep: Expression of course content | Video design | BGM!
* What I would change: Add a place where students can communicate and interact with each after learning the videos. If there is a certificate to show I finish the course or a function can track my learning process, that would be great.
