# Assignment 1 {#anchor}

[My Github Profile](https://github.com/jy2893)

## My Goals for HUDK 4050 {#css_id}
* Learn how to use R Markdown.
* Learn how to use R language fluently.
* Acquire the skills to understand and operate data mining in education.

## Video Review {#css_id}
For the RMarkdown video, I would like to have more examples of using RMarkdown to make notes. I like the 
length of all videos I have seen so far, keep things short and sweet. 

|   Skill  |                            Score                       |

|     R    |                             2                          |
|All videos|I hope when I click videos, they can open in a new tab. |
