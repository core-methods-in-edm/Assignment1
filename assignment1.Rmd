## My Goals for HUDK4050

* be proficient in R
* make new friends
* be able to do data analysis independently

## Video Review 

The previous course videos have well demonstrated some basic knowledge of learning R language, such as R and RMarkdown. I would like to add some videos of task operations, and keep the teaching mode of the course videos.
