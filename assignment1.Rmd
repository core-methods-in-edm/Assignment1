# Assignment 1

[My Github Profile](https://github.com/ManruiZhang)

## My Goals for HUDK4050  

* Learn how to code with R
* Know different ways to do data mining 
* Learn how to use data 

## Video Review

The pace of this course so far is novice friendly. As a starter in R, I think it's not so hard to follow and I really hope that we could keep this pace. It could be improved by mentioning some common errors that students may have.
