# Assignment 1

[To my Github profile](https://github.com/jinhangshi2008)

## My Goals for HUDK4050

- Learn how to make beautiful and creative visualizations
- Learn how to clean and mine data
- Learn how to master R

## Video Review

The video classes were made pretty well on the descriptions for every piece of knowledge and clear on step-by-step instructions. I would keep the videos short and precise.

| Skill | Score |
|:------:|:-----:|
| Visualization | 5 |
| Precise | Clear |

## This is how I am feeling about the semester
