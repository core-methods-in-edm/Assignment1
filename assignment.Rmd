# Assignment 1

Here is my [Github Profile Page](https://github.com/ChrisChen0429).


## My Goals For HUDK4050

* Have a deeper understanding about the data mining techniques and how these methods are applied in education;

* Have more practice of collaborative working (in particular, remotely).

## Video Review

* What I want to change: 
  + Add more notes on the screen when some new technique, software, or important link are mentioned during the video;
  + Go through more examples when talking about the new techniques;

* What I want to keep:
  + The overall style of the video is very clear and straightforward.
