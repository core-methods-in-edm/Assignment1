 ## My Goals for HUDK4050

 * Goal 1: Improve visual appeal of my graphs and tables
 * Goal 2: Get super familiar with GitHub and Git version control
 * Goal 3: Improve loop-writing ability for better abstraction in my code

 ## Video Review

 The class videos are well-edited and enjoyable to watch. One way to improve asynchronous discussion in the class could be posing a difficult question at the end of the videos and asking people to respond in the comment section.
