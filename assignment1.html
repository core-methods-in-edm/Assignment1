## Video Review

- I love the practicity and directeness of this mini lectures we have had so far. I would definetly keep that. However, some more interactive version of it simulation a class would definetly make the experience a little better. I miss the feeling of being in a class room.



| Skill           | Score                                           |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Coding in R`     | 3/10                                           |
| `So far so good`  | actually I enjoyed the material                   |
| `A little more interactivity would hurt` | Maybe more kind of "lectures" wouldnt hurt|       

## This is how I am feeling about the semester
